PHASE 3 WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE

This repository consists of a lib folder with three separate files which tackle a specific function 
1. time_converter.py

This file has a function that converts a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time. It takes in hour, minute and time of day as the arguments int the function

This has a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input.

It returns a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

2. positve_numbers.py

This file has a function that takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.
Essentially the count should strictly equal 2 since only 2 numbers should be > 0

3. consonant_value.py

This file has a function that takes in given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces and returns the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.
